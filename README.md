# Cryptic Conquest
A simple terminal game written in c using the ncurses library.

# Game Plan
The Goal of the game is to explore the dungeon and default the final boss.
In order to do so, you will need to collect good enough weapons to defeat him.
These weapons can be found inside Chests throughout the dungeon. However, the
dungeon is guarded by enemies, so you will have to take care of them before you
can safely loot the chests. Once you have leveled up enough, you will be able 
to take on the final boss. The levels will be viewed from the top down and will
be made up of fancy ascii characters.
