# Cryptic Conquest
A simple terminal game written in c using the ncurses library.

# Game Plan
The Goal of the game is to explore the dungeon and defeat all the enemies.
In order to do so, you will need to collect all 4 items (bow,shield,hourglass, and a big sword).
These weapons can be found inside Chests throughout the dungeon. However, the
dungeon is guarded by enemies, so you will have to evade them in order to
loot the chests. Once you have all the items, you will be able 
defeat all the enemies and win! The levels will be viewed from the top down and will
be made up of fancy ascii characters.
